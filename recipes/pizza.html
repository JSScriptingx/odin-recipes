<img src="../Pics/pizza.png" alt="a delicious looking pepperoni pizza that you're gonna make">
<p>I love pizza, so pepperoni pizza is usually a surefire dinner win. But if I'm being honest, I rarely make pizza. 
I view pizza as a cheat night for me, and I get delivery. </p>
<p>So when I decided to make pizza at home, I knew it needed to be better than your average delivery. 
It needed tons of pepperoni, a nice crust, great flavor.</p>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade (I like this no-knead version, though note that this recipe makes enough dough for 2 pizzas)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
    <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni </li>
    <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated </li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
    <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 500Â°F for 20 mins</li>
    <li>Roll out the dough</li>
    <li>Add the toppings & pizza sauce</li>
    <li>Cook the pizza for 6mins and then rotate then cook again for 6 mins
        or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots
    </li>
    <li>Slice & serve</li>
</ol>
